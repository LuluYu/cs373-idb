This was a 4 week project that my group and I completed for our Software Engineering class at The University of Texas during the Summer of 2014. It required creating a database with a collection of information and using the Django framework to create an app that displayed this information to a site. Our app is hosted by Pythonanywhere, documentation for the RESTful ApI is available on Apiary, pages styled with Twitter Bootstrap, and Mysql database contains all the sites content.
